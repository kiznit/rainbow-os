Building Rainbow
================

Required tools
--------------

To build Rainbow from your existing operating system, the following tools are
required (version numbers show what I am using and do not indicate strict
requirements):

    1) binutils 2.30 (cross-platform tools)
    2) gcc 7.3.0 (cross-platform compilers)
    3) MinGW-w64 (i686-w64-mingw32 and x86_64-w64-mingw32 cross-compilers)
    5) GNU Make 4.1
    6) Python 3.5.2 (for configure script)

If you are unsure how to produce the required binutils and gcc cross-compilers,
take a look here: http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler.

There is also an easy to use Makefile here: https://github.com/kiznit/build-gcc-and-binutils

To generate an ISO image of Rainbow, you will also need:

    6) grub-mkrescue 2.02

And finally if you want to run your iso image under an emulator, I use qemu:

    7) qemu-system-xxx 2.6.50


Supported configurations
------------------------

| Description    | Machine   | Architectures |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| BIOS firmware  | bios      | ia32, x86_64  |
| EFI firmware   | efi       | ia32, x86_64  |
| Raspberry Pi   | raspi     | arm           |
| Raspberry Pi 2 | raspi2    | arm           |
| Raspberry Pi 3 | raspi3    | arm, aarch64  |


Build
-----

1) Create a directory where you want the build to happen. I simply create a 'build' directory under the root of Rainbow:

    mkdir build

2) Run the configure script from the build directory you just created. This will generate a Makefile in the current directory.

    cd build
    ../configure

3) Create the OS image

    make image

4) Run the image in the emulator

    make run

5) Run tests

    make test
