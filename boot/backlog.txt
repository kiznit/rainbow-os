Boot
====

- IBoot interface (?)
- Replace printf() with something better (but maybe not C++ streams)
- Finish EDID
- Finish VBE
- BIOS: need a way to allocate buffers in low memory when calling BIOS
    --> Can use g_MemoryMap for now...

- Initialize page tables for kernel
- Jump to kernel
- Simplify / cleanup MemoryMap, have allocation functions return nullptr on error?



Graphics
========

- Split GraphicsDisplay from GraphicsConsole (?)
- Add a PixelDescription array and use helpers to determine pixel formats
- Fully support current pixel formats
- Add new pixel formats
- Store console text as text
- Speed up double buffering
    - Use another backbuffer in RAM and only send differences to VRAM
    - Don't Flip() so often


Console
=======

- Add input so that we can scroll console output up/down


Kernel
======

- Take over graphics / console and print some welcome message
