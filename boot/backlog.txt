Boot
====

- IBoot interface (?)
- Replace printf() with something better (but maybe not C++ streams)
- Finish EDID
- Finish VBE
- BIOS: need a way to allocate buffers in low memory when calling BIOS


Graphics
========

- Add a PixelDescription array and use helpers to determine pixel formats
- Fully support current pixel formats
- Add new pixel formats
- Store console text as text
- Speed up double buffering
    - Use another backbuffer in RAM and only send differences to VRAM
    - Don't Flip() so often


Console
=======

- Add input so that we can scroll console output up/down
