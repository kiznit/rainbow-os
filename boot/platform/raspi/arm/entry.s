    Program enty point


    Environment at boot

     The ATAG boot protocol defines a sane state for the system to be in before calling the kernel. Namely this is:

      - The CPU must be in SVC (supervisor) mode with both IRQ and FIQ interrupts disabled.
      - The MMU must be off, i.e. code running from physical RAM with no translated addressing.
      - Data cache must be off
      - Instruction cache may be either on or off
      - CPU register 0 must be 0
      - CPU register 1 must be the ARM Linux machine type
      - CPU register 2 must be the physical address of the parameter list


    The bootloader passes 3 arguments:
        r0 = 0     (Boot device ID)
        r1 = 0xC42 (ARM Linux Machine ID for Broadcom BCM2708 Video Coprocessor)
        r2 = ATAGS or Device Tree Blob (dtb)

    Preserve these registers! We want to pass them to raspi_main()
